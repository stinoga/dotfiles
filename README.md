dotfiles
========

My dot files and setup for a new machine. The shell script has the setup steps, and the dot files are what they are.

## Dropbox Sourcing

My dotfiles are setup to source from Dropbox, so they can be shared between machines. You can source them wherever makes sense to you.

Dot file awesomeness taken from a couple awesome users, [jswartwood](https://github.com/jswartwood) and [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens). This is my much smaller implementation, as some of their power use is a bit much for me :)
